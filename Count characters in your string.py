'''
The main idea is to count all the occuring characters(UTF-8) in string. If you have string like this aba then the result should be { 'a': 2, 'b': 1 }

What if the string is empty ? Then the result should be empty object literal { }

def count(string):
    count = {}
    for i in string:
        count[i] = string.count(i)
    return count
